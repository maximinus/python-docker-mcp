## Plan

We need to:

1: Create a docker instance master copy
2: Start the instance, create a venv with uv
3: Set a master cache for uv (?)
4: Write a script to replicate a venv in place
5: Write functions to handle the mcp
6: Export the mcp functions
7: Add tests to all of the above
8: Package as MCP
9: Write documentation
